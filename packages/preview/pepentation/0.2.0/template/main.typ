== Greatest common divisor

#text(size: 0.95em)[
  #definition[
    *Definition – Euclid's algorithm*

    The function `gcd(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor of two integers.
  ]

  #warning[
    *Warning – undefined case*

    `gcd(a, 0)` is fine, but `gcd(0, 0)` is mathematically undefined.
    Your implementation should reject or handle this explicitly
  ]

  #remark[
    *Remark – symmetry property*

    `gcd(a, b)` should always equal `gcd(b, a)`. You can use this to test
    your implementation
  ]

  #hint[
    *Hint – simplifying fractions with gcd*

    Once `gcd(a,b)` works, you can reduce fractions to lowest terms
